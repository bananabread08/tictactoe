##Tic-Tac-Toe Project

A project to showcase what we learned about Objects and apply Factory Functions & Modules in the code skeleton.

Functionality:
1. Play a TTT game. Human vs. Human. (Will add AI soon).
2. Show's whose turn it is via gamestate.
3. Reset button to refresh game. 
4. Show winner / tie if Win Conditions are passed.

What I learned: 
1. OOP especially about Factory Functions and Modules. 
2. Closures!
3. The `{once: true}` event options. 
4. Some JS & CSS tricks using `display: none` to make a pseudo page 2 or page 3++ of webpage.
5. Did I mention OOP? 

Future update: Implement minimax Algorithm to make Unbeatable AI (hopefully!).
