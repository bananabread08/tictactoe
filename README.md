## Overview

A project to showcase what we learned about Objects and apply Factory Functions & Modules in the code skeleton.

## Features & Functionality:

1. Play a TTT game. Human vs. Human. (Will add AI soon).
2. Show's whose turn it is via gamestate.
3. Reset button to refresh game.
4. Show winner / tie if Win Conditions are passed.

## Objectives & Outcomes

Learned a few things:

1. OOP especially about Factory Functions and Modules.
2. Closures!
3. The `{once: true}` event options.
4. Some JS & CSS tricks using `display: none` to make a pseudo page 2 or page 3++ of webpage.
5. Did I mention OOP?

## Development

Built with:

- HTML + CSS
- JS
- eslint + prettier

## Usage / Running Project Locally

1. Clone the Repository (`git clone ...`).
2. Run the `index.html` to your preferred browser.

Future update: Implement minimax Algorithm to make Unbeatable AI (hopefully!).
